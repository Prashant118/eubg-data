* Prefixes file
* Instance model file in Turtle format
* Instance model files for diagrams
* Generated ontology file in RDF format
* Generated online documentation using LODE
* RDF shapes for validation

Please copy diagrams to the gdoc, and provide links to full-size diagrams and source files here.
